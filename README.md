# Toffy-Console

Toffy-Console is a lightweight, modular AI framework designed to demonstrate core neural network functionalities, including tokenization, embeddings, attention mechanisms, feedforward layers, and more, for building language models and chatbots. This project provides a text-based interface where users can input sentences, and the model processes them through various layers to predict words based on input tokens.



## Requirements:
- C++11 or later
- C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, MSVC)

## How to Build and Run:
1. Clone or download the project to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE or use a command-line compiler to build the program.
3. Compile the project to generate the executable.
4. Run the executable. It will prompt you to enter a sentence.
5. The model will process your input through various layers and predict a token based on the input.
